## Caesar Cipher

The Caesar cipher is one of the earliest known and simplest ciphers. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet. 

For example, with a shift of 3, A would be replaced by D, B would become E, and so on.

### So, if the plaintext is "HELLO WORLD", then after encryption, it would become "KHOOR ZRUOG".
