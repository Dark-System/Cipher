## Substitution Cipher

* In a substitution cipher, we “encrypt” (i.e., conceal in a reversible way) a message by replacing every letter with another letter.<br>
* To do so, we use a key: in this case, a mapping of each of the letters of the alphabet to the letter it should correspond to when we encrypt it.<br> 
* To “decrypt” the message, the receiver of the message would need to know the key, so that they can reverse the process: translating the encrypt text (generally called ciphertext) back into the original message (generally called plaintext).

For example, if the user inputs a key of ```YTNSHKVEFXRBAUQZCLWDMIPGJO``` and a plaintext of ```HELLO``` then output will be ```EHBBQ```

### So, if key is ```"VCHPRZGJNTLSKFBDQWAXEUYMOI"``` the plaintext is ```"hello, world"```, then after encryption, it would become ```"jrssb, ybwsp"```.
